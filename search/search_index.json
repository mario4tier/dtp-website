Can be uni or bi-directional. An end-user creates a connection by calling a function into the destination DTP Node object (See Connection API).</p> <p>End-Point: An off-chain process that can send/receive data. An end point can handle multiple local end users, protocols and connections simultaneously (each independently encrypted).</p> <p>End-User: A signature authority that can send/receive data.</p> <p>Node Object: Any end-user that want to transfer data must create its own Node object. This is a Sui shared object involved in many control plane transactions (e.g. creation of a connection). The node allows to configure the services (and SLA) that are to be provided, the lifecycle of its associated connections, the management of its end-points. Nodes also control the firewall.\\ Nodes are shared Sui object.</p> <p>Objects: Usually refer to on-chain Sui objects ( See Sui Docs )</p> <p>Pipe Object: End-points can never directly exchange data with each other directly (their IP is not known to the peer). All data plane transfers involves an intermediate object on the Sui network. One pipe is required per direction of a connection. A pipe can from time to time change the endpoint for high-availability or load balancing (if the end-user have configured multiple end-point to its Node).

Example would be \"sent data can be deleted from network storage after 48 hours (2 epochs)\". The client signify that it agrees to a SLA at the time the connection to the node is initiated.
